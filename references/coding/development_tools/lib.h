/**
 * File: lib.h
 *       Example file used to demonstrate the usage of the #include prepocessor
 *       directive.
 *
 *       Preprocessor directives are lines included in a program that begin with
 *       the character #, which make them different from a typical source code
 *       text. They are invoked by the compiler to process some programs before
 *       compilation. Preprocessor directives change the text of the source code
 *       and the result is a new source code without these directives.
 *
 *       A preprocessor directive is usually placed in the top of the source
 *       code in a separate line beginning with the character "#", followed by
 *       directive name and an optional white space before and after it. A
 *       preprocessor directive statement must not end with a semicolon (;).
